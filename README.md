**Networked Service Course - TritonTransfer**

## Overview
This project is implemented by using the Apache Thrift RPC framework
to build a Dropbox-like cloud storage system. TritonTransfer consists of 
services that will allow clients to upload and download files through 
block server service and metadata service. The metadata service is implemented
by distributed servers that will maintain the data whether a network or server 
fails. 

Language used: Python

## Implementations
- Implement a protocol for block file transfer based on Dropbox
- Developed distributed service with RPC framework
- Implement fault tolerance (when networks fail) using read and write quorum
